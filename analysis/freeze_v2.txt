BASELINE FREEZE — v2 

Date: 26 Dec

Status

Weather classifier upgraded to ResNet18 (fine-tuned)

~70–71% validation accuracy

Model saved as weather_resnet18_ft.pth

YOLOv8 detector trained, frozen, and exported to ONNX

End-to-end weather-aware perception pipeline runs successfully

Pipeline output strictly follows the frozen contract

Git repository initialized, clean, and committed

Frozen Components

Pipeline interface (run_pipeline input/output contract)

YOLO detector

No retraining

ONNX model locked

Risk profile logic (rule-based visibility)

Project structure

Allowed Changes (Post-Freeze)

Weather model improvements only if backward compatible

Internal refactoring without changing pipeline outputs

Additional evaluation, logging, or visualization

New models added alongside, not replacing baseline

Rules

No changes to:

Pipeline return format

Key names or data types

Any new model must be explicitly versioned

Baseline v2 must always remain runnable

Technical Anchor

Pipeline entrypoint:
code/pipeline/main.py

Frozen output contract defined in pipeline docstring

Reference models:

Weather: models/weather/weather_resnet18_ft.pth

Detection: runs/detect/train6/weights/best.onnx

Reason

This freeze preserves a strong, working, end-to-end baseline with:

realistic weather understanding

reliable object detection

reproducible results

safe rollback point for future experimentation
