BASELINE FREEZE — v3

Date: 27 Dec

Status:
- Weather classifier: ResNet18 fine-tuned (~71% val acc)
- YOLOv8 detector frozen (ONNX)
- End-to-end pipeline verified
- Showcase results saved (correct + incorrect cases)
- Repo clean and reproducible

Notes:
- Confidence values reflect uncertainty, not accuracy
- Misclassifications with low confidence are expected
- No post-hoc correction applied

Rules:
- No pipeline interface changes
- No YOLO retraining
- Weather improvements must preserve API
- Any future confidence calibration or auxiliary model (e.g., UNet) must not modify raw classifier outputs.

Reason:
This freeze preserves a scientifically honest system
for evaluation, comparison, and future calibration.
