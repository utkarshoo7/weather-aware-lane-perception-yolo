BASELINE FREEZE — v4

Date: 29 Dec

Status:
- Weather classifier: ResNet18 fine-tuned (~71% val accuracy)
- YOLOv8 detector frozen (ONNX)
- UNet lane segmentation trained on TuSimple
- UNet integrated non-invasively (internal use only)
- End-to-end pipeline verified
- Output contract unchanged
- Repo clean and reproducible

Rules:
- No changes to pipeline output schema
- No YOLO retraining
- UNet outputs must remain internal unless versioned
- Weather confidence handling unchanged until calibration phase

Reason:
This freeze preserves a multi-task perception system
(weather + detection + lane understanding)
with strict backward compatibility.
