FAILURE ANALYSIS



*Observed Failure Modes*


~Reduced detection confidence in adverse weather
 In rainy, snowy, and partly cloudy conditions, the object detection model shows reduced confidence scores for correctly detected objects. This leads to missed detections when using a fixed confidence threshold.

~False negatives during low-visibility scenes
 Night-time and overcast scenes reduce contrast and visibility, causing the detector to miss smaller or distant objects such as bicycles, traffic signs, and riders.

~Overconfidence in clear conditions
 In clear daylight scenes, a low global confidence threshold increases false positives, especially for visually similar classes like traffic signs and traffic lights.

~Class imbalance sensitivity
 Rare classes (e.g., traffic_sign, train) suffer from unstable predictions, especially under non-ideal lighting or weather conditions.



*Root Cause Analysis*


~Standard YOLO inference uses a single static confidence threshold, which does not adapt to scene context.

~Weather and lighting significantly alter image statistics (brightness, contrast, noise), but the detector is unaware of these changes.

~Training on large datasets improves general performance but does not eliminate context-specific degradation.

~Increasing overall confidence to reduce false positives worsens recall in adverse conditions.



*Why Traditional Fixes Are Insufficient*


~Simply increasing training epochs does not solve context-dependent failures.

~Data augmentation alone cannot fully represent real-world weather diversity.

~Training separate models per condition increases complexity and deployment cost.

~Post-processing heuristics without context awareness are brittle and inconsistent.



*System-Level Mitigation Strategy*


~The proposed pipeline introduces a weather classification stage before object detection.

~A CNN predicts the current weather condition of the scene.

~The detected weather dynamically controls YOLO’s confidence threshold.

~Lower thresholds are used in adverse conditions to preserve recall.

~Higher thresholds are used in clear conditions to reduce false positives.

~This approach mitigates failures without retraining YOLO or duplicating models.



*Remaining Limitations*

~Weather classification accuracy is not perfect and may introduce occasional misclassification.

~Threshold adaptation is rule-based and not learned end-to-end.

~Extremely rare classes remain challenging under poor visibility.


These limitations are acknowledged and left as future improvement directions.
